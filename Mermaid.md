  id1[Brainstorming  Choose a topic. You want to generate as many ideas as possible about your topic, often called freewriting.]
  
  id2[Outline  Organize your thoughts and ideas as you develop your main point, your thesis, and how best to deliver it to your intended audience. You may also want to explore the purpose of your essay. Ask yourself why your paper matters? Once you have your main point, how best to deliver it to your audience, and the purpose of your essay.]
 
  id3[Drafting  Begin drafting the first, second, third, or even tenth version of your essay. Develop your thesis, thoughts, and arguments supporting and defending your essay. 
  
  id4[Is your Draft ready for publishing?]
  
  id5[Critique your Draft  as you dive deeper into the Drafting process. Later revisions focus more on clarity, organization, details, grammar and spelling, sentence structure, and readability.]
